# diny v1.0 - Complete Rework

## Thanks for the Support

I didn't expect diny to get nearly 100 stars. Your feedback has been incredible, and it showed me what diny could become: **not just a plug-and-play tool, but a flexible, customizable commit message generator that adapts to how you work**.

v0.4 was simple, but limited. One LLM, one backend, no customization. That's changing.

**I'm rebuilding diny to give you full control.**

## What's Changing?

### Full Customization

v1.0 lets you customize everything:

- **Choose your LLM** - Use cloud.diny.run (default) or local Ollama
- **Custom prompts** - Tweak how diny generates messages 
- **Privacy control** - Local mode keeps everything on your machine, cloud mode is transparent about data handling
- **Model selection** - Pick which AI model works best for you

### Better Architecture

- **Monorepo** - Cleaner codebase, easier to extend
- **TypeScript** - Better tooling, faster development
- **Modular design** - Swap providers, customize behavior
- **Same simplicity** - Still zero-config by default
